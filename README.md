## üöÄ Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up and run the game locally.

### ‚úÖ Prerequisites
- **Python** (version 3.x)
- **Turtle Graphics** (comes pre-installed with Python)

### üì• Installation
1. **Clone the repository**: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CrossTheRoad.git`
2. **Navigate into the project directory**: `cd CrossTheRoad`
3. **Run the game**: `python main.py`

---

## üéÆ How to Play
1. **Objective**: Cross the road by avoiding the cars and reaching the finish line.
2. **Controls**:
   - ‚¨ÜÔ∏è `Up Arrow`: Move forward.
   - ‚¨áÔ∏è `Down Arrow`: Move backward.
3. **Gameplay**:
   - Wait for the "GO!" signal after the highway populates with cars.
   - Use the arrow keys to navigate and avoid obstacles.
   - Each successful crossing increases the level and the speed of traffic.

## üõ†Ô∏è Code Structure
This game was built using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, with each key element of the game represented as a separate class for modularity and scalability.
- **`Player` Class** (`player.py`): Controls player movement and position reset when leveling up.
- **`CarManager` Class** (`car_manager.py`): Manages car spawning, movement, and speed increment as levels progress.
- **`Scoreboard` Class** (`scoreboard.py`): Displays the level, game over message, and "GO!" start signal.
- **`BackgroundSetter` Class** (`background.py`): Creates and renders the road and grass lanes, as well as the striped lines for visual effect.

---

## üìö Key Concepts Demonstrated
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Implemented core classes (`Player`, `CarManager`, `Scoreboard`, `BackgroundSetter`) to organize and modularize code.
- **Encapsulation**: Each class encapsulates specific functionalities and properties, promoting clean code.
- **Inheritance**: Inherited from Turtle class to leverage the `Turtle` graphics library for easy visualization.
