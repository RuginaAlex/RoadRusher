# üõ£Ô∏è Cross the Road Game

**Cross the Road** is a retro-inspired game where players navigate through a busy highway filled with fast-moving cars. The goal is to cross the road safely without colliding with any obstacles. This project was created using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles to demonstrate modular and organized code structure, enhancing the gameplay experience.

## üåü Features
- üéÆ **Interactive gameplay**: Dodge oncoming cars as you move forward across multiple lanes.
- üõ§Ô∏è **Multiple lanes with alternating traffic directions**: Cars move in different directions on each lane, adding a realistic challenge.
- üöÄ **Dynamic level progression**: As you cross the highway, the level increases, speeding up the traffic.
- üïπÔ∏è **Retro graphics and animations**: Simple graphics bring a nostalgic feel to the game.

## üöÄ Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up and run the game locally.

### ‚úÖ Prerequisites
- **Python** (version 3.x)
- **Turtle Graphics** (comes pre-installed with Python)

### üõ†Ô∏è Installation
1. **Clone the repository**: `git clone https://github.com/RuginaAlex/RoadRusher.git`
2. **Navigate into the project directory**: `cd Turtle\ Crossing`
3. **Run the game**: `python main.py`

---

## üéÆ How to Play
1. **Objective**: Cross the road by avoiding the cars and reaching the finish line.
2. **Controls**:
   - ‚¨ÜÔ∏è `Up Arrow`: Move forward.
   - ‚¨áÔ∏è `Down Arrow`: Move backward.
3. **Gameplay**:
   - Wait for the "GO!" signal after the highway populates with cars.
   - Use the arrow keys to navigate and avoid obstacles.
   - Each successful crossing increases the level and the speed of traffic.

## üõ†Ô∏è Code Structure
This game was built using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, with each key element of the game represented as a separate class for modularity and scalability.
- **`Player` Class** (`player.py`): Controls player movement and position reset when leveling up.
- **`CarManager` Class** (`car_manager.py`): Manages car spawning, movement, and speed increment as levels progress.
- **`Scoreboard` Class** (`scoreboard.py`): Displays the level, game over message, and "GO!" start signal.
- **`BackgroundSetter` Class** (`background.py`): Creates and renders the road and grass lanes, as well as the striped lines for visual effect.

## üìú Development History

This section provides a visual history of the project's development, showcasing how the game evolved over time.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ The Beginning
Everything started with a simple Turtle object on an empty screen. The initial setup was basic‚Äîa single turtle icon displayed at the center of a blank, white screen. This small setup marked the start of what would become an interactive game, gradually growing into a multi-level, traffic-dodging adventure.

![Initial Turtle Setup](screenshots/first_step.png)  
*The very first version: a single Turtle object on an empty canvas.*

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Adding Obstacles
The next stage introduced moving obstacles (cars) with simple rectangular shapes, which added an initial level of challenge.

![Obstacles Added](screenshots/second_step.png)  
*Obstacles were added, giving players a reason to avoid collisions.*

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Improved Graphics and Character Animation
At this stage, graphics were significantly improved. The cars were represented by pixel-art graphics inspired by **GTA 1**, and the main character was selected from **Hotline Miami**, adding a unique retro touch to the game. The character has two states:
   - **Alive**: The default state when crossing the road.
   - **Dead**: Two distinct animations that play when the character collides with a car.

*The player character when alive, ready to cross the road.*

![Character Dead](walker_graph/dead1.gif)  
![Character Dead](screenshots/dead2.gif)  
*The player character with two distinct animations upon "death", adding a touch of realism and dynamic feedback.*

This stage also included a "level-up" mechanic, allowing players to experience increased difficulty as they progressed.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Road and Environment Creation
The road and environment were drawn programmatically using **Turtle Graphics**. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of how it was done:
   - **Grass Lanes**: Green rectangles were drawn at the top, middle, and bottom of the screen to represent safe zones where players can rest.
   - **Road Lanes**: Gray rectangles were drawn between the grass zones to serve as the road. This visual separation makes it clear where the danger zones are.
   - **Lane Stripes**: Yellow stripes were added along the road to separate lanes and mimic the look of a highway, enhancing the gameplay experience.

These elements were created using the `BackgroundSetter` class, which controlled the Turtle's movement to draw lines and stripes at specific locations on the screen. The Turtle‚Äôs `penup()` and `pendown()` methods were used to control when it draws and when it simply moves, allowing precise placement of each road element.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Final Version with Demo
The final version includes all features: enhanced graphics, animations, score tracking, and a "GO!" signal to indicate when the game is ready to start. Additionally, a demo video has been included below to showcase gameplay mechanics and graphics in action.

## üìö Key Concepts Demonstrated
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Implemented core classes (`Player`, `CarManager`, `Scoreboard`, `BackgroundSetter`) to organize and modularize code.
- **Encapsulation**: Each class encapsulates specific functionalities and properties, promoting clean code.
- **Inheritance**: Inherited from Turtle class to leverage the `Turtle` graphics library for easy visualization.
